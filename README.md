# spy_your_mate_project

In this project, the objective is to analyse the traffic generated by a webcam call and, from such traffic, identify whether a person or only the background is recorded in the video. 
The problem was approached from a Machine Learning perspective: various ML algorithms were applied and results from each were compared to evaluate the best one for the scenario in terms of accuracy and precision.
